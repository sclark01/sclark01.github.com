1. This was for Intro the Web Programming, taken at Tufts University Department of Computer Science in the Spring of 2013
2. My favorite project was either project 3 (Where in the World) or project 5 (score center).
3. I was most proud of assignment 3 
4. I have definitely grown a lot in this course both in web programming and programming in general. I have a much better understanding of how the web works and how web apps are developed.
