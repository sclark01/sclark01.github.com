<h1 class="center">A little Bit About Me...</h1>
<p class="paragraph center">I was born on October 15th 1992 in Los Angeles, CA to parents Patty Clark and Gary Tieche. In 1st grade, my parents took me to Paris for the first time, and from then on I've been addicted to traveling. After sophomore year of high school I was fortunate enough to be able to spend my summer in Vietnam. There, I worked along side with Vietnamese to build "Compassion Houses" from the ground up. </p>
